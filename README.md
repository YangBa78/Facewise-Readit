# Facewise-READIT

This repo contains two interactive platforms(Facewise -- face verification, and Readit -- text summarization) in the Triad Project. They were designed based on MAST criteria, a checklist to build and evaluate a trustworthy AI-enabled system, and used to collect users' responses to evaluate the usability of MAST criteria. 

See README under readit and facewise folder for detailed instructions of implementation. I will write a detailed description later.
