# Facewise-READIT

This repo contains two interactive platforms(Facewise -- face verification, and Readit -- text summarization) in the Triad Project. They were designed based on MAST criteria, a checklist to build and evaluate a trustworthy AI-enabled system, and used to collect users' responses to evaluate the usability of MAST criteria. 

Specifically, they were used to collect online and offline data for the papers below: 

Facewise: "Data Quality in Crowdsourcing and Spamming Behavior Detection". 

Readit: "PADTHAI-MM: A Principled Approach for Designing Trustable, Human-centered AI Systems using the MAST Methodology". 

Both Facewise and Readit: "Evaluating Trustworthiness of AI-Enabled Decision Support Systems: Validation of the Multisource AI Scorecard Table (MAST)"

See README under readit and facewise folder for detailed instructions of implementation.
